Kopfkino is a library providing syntactic sugar sprinkled on top of MoviePy and AI components, to allow authoring of simple human-friendly video scripts.

Kopfkino (German, Ààk…îpfÀåkiÀêno) roughly translates to "movie theater of your mind", describing a kind of daydreaming when your imagination produces vivid images right in your head. It addresses the main purpose of this project ‚Äî give you a convenient way to convert your ideas into movie scripts (which are also Python scripts), for producing e-learning videos and such, using an expressive [DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language).

It enables you to concentrate on your content and its timeline, hiding away most of the technical details and quirks of underlying packages doing the grunt work, like [MoviePy](https://pypi.org/project/moviepy/).

## Features

Major functions and use-cases:
 * Rough and final cut of your recordings.
 * Adding a title screen and end credits.
 * Adding subtitles, optionally also converted to audio via an AI voice (TTS / text to speech).
 * Using audio loops for background music.

 There is an [early proof of concept](https://youtu.be/ZAGDNwk7Bd8?si=2dRlIfLR_fYQENB9) on YouTube, to give you an idea of the end result.
